    <h2>Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows</h2>
    <p>If you're lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But I wasn't
        so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I'm here to help you out. First, plan out
        which shows are most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie:
        SET A BUDGET. If you're worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you
        won't have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers
        you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!</p>
